<center>Experiment: Measurement Of Steam Quality</center>

**1. Story Outline**:

When a substance is in the compressed liquid region or the superheated vapour region, pressure and temperature are independent properties. They are measured to determine the state of the substance. But when a substance is in the saturated or two-phase region, out of pressure and temperature, only one quantity is independent, the other is a dependent property.
In this case, to determine the state of the mixture, apart from either temperature or pressure, one more property, such as specific volume, enthalpy or quality of the mixture must be known. Because it is comparatively harder to measure the specific volume of a mixture, calorimeters are utilized to obtain the quality or the enthalpy of the mixture.

The goal, in the measurement of quality, is to change the state of the substance from the two-phase region to the single-phase or superheated region. Here, both temperature and pressure are independent properties and can be measured to determine the state of the substance. This goal is achieved by adiabatic throttling.

Throttling is a process in which the conversion of high-pressure fluid into a low-pressure fluid takes place. This process is carried out using a throttle valve. The enthalpy remains constant in a throttling process.

In the throttling calorimeter, a sample of wet steam of pressure P1 is obtained from a steam main by means of a perforated sampling tube. It is then throttled by the partially open valve to a pressure P2 and temperature T2. This is done so that after throttling, the steam is in the superheated region. According to the steady flow energy equation, the enthalpy after throttling is equal to the enthalpy before throttling. The initial state (wet) is given by P1 and x1, while the final state (superheated) is given by P2 and T2.

In this experiment, the quality of steam is measured using a throttling-valve setup. Given the initial pressure P1, the final temperature T2 and the final pressure P2 of steam, the quality ‘x1’ of steam is determined. Here, the variables that can be changed by the user are T2 and P2 (from a given set of pre-set values), while P1 remains constant as the pressure of the saturated fluid. By changing the two variables using a slider, the user can see the corresponding change in the quality and enthalpy of steam and visualize it using a bar graph.

 **2. Story**:

  **2.1 Set the visual stage description**:

  The experiment consists of a pipe fitted with a throttle valve arrangement. All the buttons and the parameters control are on the right side of the frame. The variable panel contains sliders for Outlet temperature and Outlet pressure.
  The throttling-valve setup is two horizontal lines which make up the pipe and a rectangle and a trapezium which make up the throttle valve.
  By changing the parameters, for example, Outlet temperature, the final temperature of the throttling-valve setup changes. By changing Outlet pressure, the final pressure of the throttling-valve setup changes.
